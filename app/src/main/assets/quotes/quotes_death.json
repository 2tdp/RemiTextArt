  "To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.",
  "I'm not afraid of death; I just don't want to be there when it happens.",
  "Love never dies a natural death. It dies because we don't know how to replenish its source. It dies of blindness and errors and betrayals. It dies of illness and wounds; it dies of weariness, of witherings, of tarnishings.",
  "I wish it need not have happened in my time,\" said Frodo.\n\"So do I,\" said Gandalf, \"and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.",
  "I'm the one that's got to die when it's time for me to die, so let me live my life the way I want to.",
  "The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.",
  "Death ends a life, not a relationship.",
  "Death's got an Invisibility Cloak?\" Harry interrupted again.\n\"So he can sneak up on people,\" said Ron. \"Sometimes he gets bored of running at them, flapping his arms and shrieking...",
  "A thing is not necessarily true because a man dies for it.",
  "It is said that your life flashes before your eyes just before you die. That is true, it's called Life.",
  "I do not fear death. I had been dead for billions and billions of years before I was born, and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it.",
  "I don't want to die without any scars.",
  "It kills me sometimes, how people die.",
  "Unbeing dead isn't being alive.",
  "When people don't express themselves, they die one piece at a time."
